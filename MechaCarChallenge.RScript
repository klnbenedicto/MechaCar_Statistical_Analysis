## Challenge 15
## Deliverable 1
# 3. Use the library() fuction to load the dplyr
library(dplyr)

# 4. Import and read the MechaCar_mpg.csv file as a dataframe.
mpg <- read.csv(file='MechaCar_mpg.csv', check.names=F, stringsAsFactors=F)

# 5. Perform linear regression using the lm() fuction. Pass all six variables and add the data frame created as the data parameter.
head(mpg)
lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD, data=mpg)

# 6. Using the summary() function, determine the p-value and r-squared value for the model.
summary(lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD, data=mpg))


## Deliverable 2
# 2. Import and read the MechaCar_mpg.csv file as a dataframe.
susp_coil <- read.csv(file='Suspension_Coil.csv', check.names=F, stringsAsFactors=F)

# 3. Write an RScript that creates a total_summary dataframe using the summarize() function to get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil's PSI column.
total_summary <- susp_coil %>% summarize(Mean=mean(PSI), Median=median(PSI), Var=var(PSI), Std_Dev=sd(PSI), .groups='keep')

# 4. Write an RScript that creats a lot_summary dataframe using the group_by() and summarize() fuctions to group each mfg lot by mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil's PSI column.
lot_summary <- susp_coil %>% group_by(Manufacturing_Lot) %>% summarize(Mean=mean(PSI), Median=median(PSI), Var=var(PSI), Std_Dev=sd(PSI), .groups='keep')
